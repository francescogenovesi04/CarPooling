Carpooling Web App

A small carpooling web application that allows users to pre-book trips by selecting a start location, end location, and date.

This project was developed entirely from scratch, starting with the creation of a MySQL database based on a real-world problem: managing a carpooling system. The project includes the full design process, from diagrams and logical schemas to entity creation in MySQL.

The web interface was implemented using PHP, HTML, and CSS, creating a functional management system that allows users to search and book trips online.
